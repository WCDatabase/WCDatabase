# WCDatabase

WCDatabase ("WCDB" in short or "Webcomic Database" in full) is a database/index of webcomics that are or were free to read online for anyone in English.
You can find there more than 38k webcomics that are checked for update every day and more than 70k webcomics in total. On top of that, WCDatabase also
contains profiles of the authors of these webcomics. Simple, lightweigh, no javascript, no ads!
